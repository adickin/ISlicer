## Promotional Text (170 chars max)

Slice STL files into printer-ready G-code right on your iPhone or iPad. No account, no cloud, no network — everything runs on your device.

## Description

PalmSlice is a 3D printing slicer that runs entirely on your iPhone or iPad. Open an STL, position it on a virtual build plate, slice it, preview every layer, and export G-code to your printer — without a computer.

Under the hood it uses libslic3r, the same slicing engine that powers PrusaSlicer.

SLICE ANYWHERE
• Import STL files from the Files app
• Slice on-device — no cloud, no account, no internet connection needed
• Preview the sliced model layer by layer before you export
• Export G-code to Files, AirDrop, or share it anywhere via the share sheet

PLACE AND ADJUST MODELS
• Move, rotate, and scale with on-screen 3D gizmos or type exact values
• Lay Flat, Drop to Bed, Center, and Fit to Bed helpers
• Load several models at once, with collision and out-of-bounds highlighting
• Size warnings when a model looks like it was exported in the wrong units

PROFILES FOR YOUR PRINTER
• Built-in printer profiles imported from PrusaSlicer's vendor library, including Creality, Prusa, Elegoo, Sovol, Anycubic, Artillery, and Voron models
• Separate printer, material, and slicing profiles — create, edit, and reuse your own
• Control layer height, walls, infill, supports, brim/skirt/raft, ironing, speeds, temperatures, retraction, and fan settings

PRIVATE BY DESIGN
PalmSlice collects no data. It makes no network requests, has no analytics, and never leaves your device.

BETA NOTE
Profiles other than the Ender 3 S1 have not been print-tested and are marked "Untested" in the app. Please verify first layers and start/end G-code on your own printer.

PalmSlice is open-source software licensed under AGPL-3.0. Source code and licenses are linked from the in-app About screen.

## App Review Notes

PalmSlice has no login and no network access. To test: tap the + / import
button, choose any `.stl` file from Files (or use a sample), pick a printer and
slice profile, then tap Slice, review the layer preview, and tap Export G-code.
The app is open source (AGPL-3.0): https://github.com/adickin/ISlicer

## Screenshots (still needed — manual)

Apple requires at least one set; 6.9" (iPhone 16/17 Pro Max class, 1320×2868)
is the required size, 6.5" and iPad sizes optional. Suggested shots:

1. A model loaded on the build plate with the move gizmo showing
2. Layer preview mid-slice with the layer slider
3. The printer profile picker (shows Verified / Untested sections)
4. The expanded settings panel with the Slice and Export buttons
5. Transform panel with typed mm sizing

Capture from the simulator (`xcrun simctl io booted screenshot`) with an
iPhone 16 Pro Max / 17 Pro Max destination, or from a device.
