# Build all deps + libslic3r for real iOS device (arm64-apple-ios, PLATFORM=OS64).
# Installs into ~/ios-sysroot-dev (separate from the simulator sysroot).
#
# Run the simulator build first (./build.sh) so that step 0-2 have already
# run (tools, toolchain, PrusaSlicer source). This script starts at step 3
# by default since deps 0-2 are platform-independent.
#
# Usage:
#   ./build_device.sh             # build device deps + package dual XCFramework
#   ./build_device.sh --from 11   # re-run from GMP onwards
#   ./build_device.sh --only 18   # rebuild libslic3r only

# Steps 0-2 (tools, toolchain, PrusaSlicer clone) are shared; skip them if
# a device-only rebuild is all that is needed. Default: start at step 3.
